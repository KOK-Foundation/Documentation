# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The global market for cultural content is expected to reach around 1,000 trillion won as of 2022. In particular, the portion of digital content is expected to reach 53 percent in 2021, compared to only 33.5 percent in 2012, and has grown rapidly by more than 20 percent annually.
In order to enjoy cultural content in the past, we had to go to a theater or a concert hall, but now we can easily enjoy all the contents with a mobile phone.

The digital content market displayed significant growth with the advent of digital content platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, and the Play Store, whiche nabled the active distribution of content anywhere in the world.

However, as globalization accelerates, the monopoly of several large platforms has deepened, resulting in greater platform influence over content providers.

Eventually, content providers are experiencing a vicious cycle of profitability, offering a huge fees to the platform while failing to seize the opportunity to properly expose their content. Moreover, as the platform has a huge influence in selecting content, the market has been distorted by the uniformity of the content according to the direction of the platform, and the content ecosystem is to be degenerated.

The recently emerged blockchain technology has demonstrated the potential of building a democratic system through its core value, decentralization. Certain blockchain technologies are not governed by groups or central forces, and all transactions and events are transparently disclosed. Therefore, there is no risk of forgery or counterfeiting. KOK Foundation has developed a digital content distribution platform through blockchain, noting the potentiality and possibility of blockchain technology.

KOK PLAY is a decentralized digital content platform that was created through the combination of our AI, big data, and the blockchain technology, which is currently in the spotlight. To solve the problem of monopolization of the existing global platforms, it was developed to realize three values: 'Fair, Share, and Enabler.' KOK PLAY is a platform that allows all creators to fairly exploit the assets of the platform(Fair), share values, vision, and fair returns accordingly(Share), and ensures creatorâ€™s freedom to create(Enabler). KOK PLAY will make the vision into a reality together with you.
